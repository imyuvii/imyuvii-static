### My expertise

#### PHP
This is where all it began. Technology that fall me in love with Web Development. I was more of desktop application guy and Java guy. I got oppertunity to work with php back in 2010 as intern. Since than I never look back. So many frameworks and cms I've worked.

`lambda` `Laravel` `Yii` `Yii2` `CodeIgniter` `PHP7` `Php5` `Phpunit` `Composer` `MVC Selenium` `Laravel Dusk` `Chrome WebDriver` `Restful API` `Soap API`

#### Laravel
Addictive framework. Recently I've developed a solution using Laravel, which manages infinite WooCommerce portals using single admin panel. Admin can manage orders, customers and products of the any WooCommerce store. Products, customers and orders are synced using the woocommerce webhooks.

#### WordPress
WordPress core is amazing, I loved it. It changed the way PHP has been used all of these years. It has used all of the PHP potentials and turned into beautiful user friendly CMS. WordPress core will amazed you as a developer. I literally feared when WordPress introduced. I thought there will be no need of a developer to built a website, anyone can built their own website using WordPress. Instead, WordPress has created lots of oppertunities for developers. Like creatign themes, plugins and various integrations.

`customization` `themes` `plugin development` `hosting` `debugging` `multi-site` `performance` `optimization`

#### Yii/Yii2
My First encounter with MVC. Framework that made me fall in love with PHP and MVC structure, There is no better use of MVC than Yii has done. It allows you to focus on features of your application withot worriying about architecture, file structure and technology. It makes devs life easy.

#### HTML/CSS
Initially I hate to do HTML but slowly I had to adopted it because their is no other alternate. Introduction of bootstrap into my career changed my life completely. I believe there is nothing you cannot achieve with Bootstrap. It allows you to focus on User Interface without worrying about css.

`bootstrap` `html` `css` `html5` `css3`

#### JavaScript/JQuery
Without any doubt JavaScript is my favorite scripting language. It allows you to code the way you like. You do not have to follow any structore or methodology to code using JavaScript. You make your own structure and go for it. Though, These days you have plenty of framework to work using JavaScript.

`jQuery` `jQueryUI` `ajax` `react` `angular` `Jade`

#### NodeJS
Though I have experience with several backend languages, I always find myself returning to JavaScript on Node. With a dynamic, declarative language, many frameworks and tools, and a vibrant ecosystem with a strong package manager, it may just be the perfect all-purpose server platform. I am intimately familiar with the platform and its quirks and thoroughly enjoy writing tools for its ecosystem.

`Sails.js` `ExpressJS` `Jade` `Npm` `Npm packages` `EmbeddedJS`

#### GIT
I love Git. I worked in SVN before and Git blew my mind with its capabilities and the workflows it supports. I have a lot of experience helping product teams set up complex workflows in Git, involving various branching strategies, continuous integration, and continuous deployment. Reach out if you'd like some help grokking workflows in Git, getting set up with the right processes, or understanding how to accomplish a particular task. I'd love to help!

`Deploy Deployment` `automation` `Continuous integration` `Continuous deployment` `Github` `Gitlab`

#### Amazon Web Services
It is my infrastructure solution of choice, providing relatively low-cost pay-as-you-go services at competitive price. I love AWS so much that I've started persuing AWS Certification, Soon I'll be AWS Certified solution architect.
