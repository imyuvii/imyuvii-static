Yes I am a freelancer, Yes i work from home, Yes i work hard to make money but some people unnecessary ask for extra work , some people ask for free courses , some people ask for free stuffs.

I am a freelancer but this does not mean i will work for free. I have bills just like you. I pay hefty rent , I pay for internet , I pay for themes . plugins , design modules and hosting fee . I also pay my helping hands who help me in getting jobs done on time.

Still some people think freelance means free work. They ignore the fact that we (the  freelancers ) makes our living hood by doing  hard  work over 16 hours a day. Each project either it is small or big . We do all projects with same sincerity. We treat all kinda of client same. We never discriminate between clients. Some clients pay $200 for a web project. Some pays only $100. We never compromise on work quality.

I am writing this article because i am fed up with such people. I created many free stuffs.

When i get any website job I have to spend money on hosting , theme files ( on clients demand ), design work ( for logo etc). I spend time on creating work flow , thinking about design and the best way to execute job. I spend time on working on the project. Sometime i spend sleepless nights.

The profit margin is below 50% . Some clients pays well. Some asks for discounts , Overall Day by day making money is going to be hard .

#### Competitions from Pakistani and Bangladeshi freelancers
Bangladeshi freelancers do same job in 1/3rd amount as compare to Indians. They bid very low. They grab jobs easily. Also i found many Bangladeshi freelancers uses their links to build up their profiles on freelancer. You may find first 10-15 reviews on Bangladeshi freelancers are  from Bangladeshi clients

#### Rise in third party fees

Now themes are costlier than what they were in 2014-2015. Some talent websites raised the fee to 15%-20% per projects.  All this effects our income. Also increasing competition is killing freelancing businesses .

#### What should i do?

Better is to stop piracy of courses .

Stop sharing free courses to unknown peoples

Stop sharing very important and money making stuffs as  free stuffs. Share some stuffs for free for marketing  proposes .

Also those visitors who wants to learn freelancing from  me. Please dont ask for free stuffs. It really hurts. I cant help with free stuffs.

I hope you understand this. I publish 5-10 articles per month , few videos on youtube.  I am available for teaching and guiding you for freelancing. But off course not for free.
