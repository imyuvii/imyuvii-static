#### What is PhpMyAdmin?
PhpMyAdmin is one of the most popular applications for MySQL databases management. It is a free tool written in PHP. Through this software you can create, alter, drop, delete, import and export MySQL database tables. You can run MySQL queries, optimize, repair and check tables, change collation and execute other database management commands. Install PhpMyAdmin isn’t an easy task. You need to do several configuration after installation.

#### How to install PhpMyAdmin?

```sh 
$ rpm -iUvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm #Adding repository
$ yum -y update
$ yum -y install phpmyadmin #Install PhpMyAdmin
```

That’s it. You can start using it by url `http:///phpMyAdmin`, Ex. http://example.com/phpMyAdmin

#### Do following changes if you face 403 forbidden issue
```sh 
$ sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/phpMyAdmin.conf
```

```apacheconfig
<Directory /usr/share/phpMyAdmin/>
   AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
   <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
     # Apache 2.4
     <RequireAny>
       Require all granted
     </RequireAny>
   </IfModule>
   <IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>
     # Apache 2.2
     Order Deny,Allow
     Deny from All
     Allow from 127.0.0.1
     Allow from ::1
   </IfModule>
</Directory>
```

In order to reinitialising changes, we need to restart the apache server.

```sh 
$ sudo apachectl restart #or:
$ /sbin/service httpd restart
```
