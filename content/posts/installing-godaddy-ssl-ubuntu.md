Basically in order to successfully install an SSL certificate you need the following things

- CSR file
- Private key
- Certificate key
- Certificate chain

#### Download Certificates
     
If your website is hosted through [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com/) (e.g. the primary domain on a GoDaddy shared hosting account, Website Builder), you don‚Äôt need to use these instructions; GoDaddy take care of the SSL installation for you.

1. On your SSL certificate home page, click Download.
    - Not in your SSL control panel? Log in to your GoDaddy account.
    - Click SSL Certificates.
    - Complete step 1 above.
2. Select the Server type you want to install the certificate on.
3. Click Download ZIP file.

#### Prepare Your Server
The first step to installing your certificate is to prepare your server directories to hold the final keys later on.

So [ssh](/tags/ssh/) into your server and do the following
```sh 
sudo mkdir /etc/apache2/ssl
chmod 700 /etc/apache2/ssl
chown www-data:www-data /etc/apache2/ssl
```

Then to be sure, do the following to install openssl. Nothing will happen naturally if openssl is already installed.

`sudo apt-get install openssl`

Then install the required ssl mods for your apache instance and activate them:

`sudo a2enmod ssl`

#### Generate the CSR

In order for GoDaddy to be able to issue our SSL certificate, we need to generate the CSR (Certificate Signing Request) key and our Private Key. In your home directory, do the following. You don‚Äôt need to do sudo at this point.

```sh 
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout example.com_ssl.key -out example.com_ssl.csr -sha256
```
After running the above command you will be required to answer some identity questions. Make sure you answer them as accurate as possible. The questions will look like something below

![CSR](/posts/images/csr-700x311.jpg)

You don‚Äôt really need to use the challenge password with GoDaddy at the time of this writing.

Now that you have completed generating the private key and the CSR, it‚Äôs time to send it through to GoDaddy.

#### Generate the Secure Certificate

Open the example.com_ssl.csr that we generated before. You can use vim or you can simply cat it to the terminal. The CSR should look like this

```jshint
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
MIICijCCAXICAQAwRTELMAkGA1UEBhMCQVUxEzARBgNVBAgTClNvbWUtU3RhdGUx
ITAfBgNVBAoTGEludGVybmV0IFdpZGdpdHMgUHR5IEx0ZDCCASIwDQYJKoZIhvcN

sWVG1SDyNqrPbyFlwsTcJjkM8CfvIbE93Z5A/A0A
-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
```
So copy the entire content from your CSR file, including the ‚Äî‚ÄìBEGIN and END.

Then login to GoDaddy, locate your secure certificate product and click launch. After that, click on setup and choose provide CSR. Then paste the content of the CSR file that you just copied previously.

When done, just wait until GoDaddy verifies your website‚Äôs identity and grant you access to download the certificate, in my case this happens very quick, at most within 10 minutes.

#### Installing the Certificate in Your Server

Once GoDaddy email you that your certificate has been generated, follow the link and download the certificate to you computer for now. Basically it‚Äôs a zip file containing 2 files, the one that looks like a randomly generated hash is your secure certificate (let‚Äôs call it `7abca5c1b8.crt` for this article), while the one that starts with gd_bundle_ is your certificate chain file.

So upload both files to your home directory in your Ubuntu server instance. You should now have the `example.com_ssl.key, 7abca5c1b8.crt, gd_bundle-g2-g1.crt`. Then move those 3 files to the ssl directory that you created previously.

Then make sure you set the correct permission to those files.

#### Create the Apache Configuration
     
In this article, we‚Äôll assume that we are using the `000-default.conf` file. This file is normally located in your `/etc/apache2/sites-available/` folder

So make a copy of this VirtualHost configuration file and call it `000-default.https.conf`

```sh 
sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.ssl.conf
```

Then open the file in your favourite editor such as VIM and make the following changes.

First, update the port in the VirtualHost opening tag.

```apacheconfig
<VirtualHost *:80>
 
to
 
<VirtualHost *:443>
```
Secondly, add the SSL rules at the beginning of the file, just after the opening tag. Please pay attention of the cipher suite rules as this is the combination that I found to be most acceptably secure at the moment.

I am no security expert of course, this secure combination was found from this website and when you finish setting up your website SSL you should test your site against attacks too. One of [the websites](https://testbit.eu/apache-sslciphersuite-without-poodle/) that you can use is [SSLlabs.com](https://www.ssllabs.com/).

```apacheconfig
<VirtualHost *:443>
        SSLEngine On
        SSLProtocol All -SSLv2 -SSLv3
        SSLHonorCipherOrder on
 
        # Prefer PFS, allow TLS, avoid SSL, for IE8 on XP still allow 3DES
        SSLCipherSuite "EECDH+ECDSA+AESGCM EECDH+aRSA+AESGCM EECDH+ECDSA+SHA384 EECDH+ECDSA+SHA256 EECDH+aRSA+SHA384 EECDH+aRSA+SHA256 EECDH+AESGCM EECDH EDH+AESGCM EDH+aRSA HIGH !MEDIUM !LOW !aNULL !eNULL !LOW !RC4 !MD5 !EXP !PSK !SRP !DSS"
 
        # Prevent CRIME/BREACH compression attacks
        SSLCompression Off
 
        # Commit to HTTPS only traffic for at least 180 days
        Header add Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15552000"
```

Now that you have added the rules for the SSL settings, you then need include the paths to the three keys that you setup before. So just after the rules above, add the following lines.

```apacheconfig
SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/7abca5c1b8.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/example.com.key
SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/apache2/ssl/gd_bundle-g2-g1.crt
```

That‚Äôs it, you just need to enable the secure configuration by using the a2ensite command

```apacheconfig
sudo a2ensite 000-default.ssl.conf
```

Lastly [restart your apache server](/posts/start-stop-restart-apache/) just to be sure.

```apacheconfig
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```

If you faces ‚Äúheaders‚Äù error that means headers doesn‚Äôt exist. Try following commands to generate headers.

```apacheconfig
cd /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
sudo ln -s ../mods-available/headers.load
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```

#### Closing

So that‚Äôs it. After following the instructions above, your server should now support https and you‚Äôll get that secure lock on the browsers. Hopefully this article helps those using GoDaddy certificate and Ubuntu server.

If you have more information to improve this instructions, please by all means leave some comments so that we all can learn üôÇ
