When working with MySQL I often use tools like [PhpMyAdmin](/posts/install-phpmyadmin-on-centos/) or sequelPro, which is a nice GUI way to manipulate MySQL database. But it wonâ€™t work sometime while importing/exporting larger databases. So sometimes you need to do mysql import on the command line.

##### Export a Large Database

```sh 
$ mysqldump -u [USERNAME] -p [DBNAME] | gzip > [/path_to_file/DBNAME].sql.gz
```

##### MySQL Import a Large Database
```sh 
# First, unzip the file.
$ gzip -d [/path_to_file/DBNAME].sql.gz
```

##### Login to mysql

```sh
$ [/path_to_mysql/]mysql -u [USERNAME] -p
```

##### Wipe out the old database and replace it with the new dump

```sh
SHOW DATABASES;
DROP DATABASE [DBNAME];
CREATE DATABASE [DBNAME];
USE [DBNAME];
SOURCE [/path_to_file/DBNAME].sql;
```
