      <description>Did you notice? Yii creates strange set of directories names like 8523d23 or 10s89b92 in assets directory, and this even happens at runtime.
Yii Assets Many applications are entirely self contained, and there’s no trouble or conflict putting necessary resources (images, CSS files, Javascript files, etc.) under the webroot:
 webroot/css/* webroot/js/* webroot/images/*  and so on. If a module needs to add one more resources, it’s added directly and referenced by the path down from webroot.</description>
