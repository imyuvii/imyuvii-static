      <description>How did I came up with this? simply because, I needed to inform marketing team whenever there is a new csv uploaded. So initially we used to watch directory on daily bases whether new CSV uploaded. That was super boring so I thought to automate this process.
I found out that inotify can help me to achieve this.
So, let&amp;rsquo;s do it.
Install inotify This library provides a thin layer on top of the basic inotify interface.</description>

      <description>Today, I&amp;rsquo;ll host a static website with https on S3, I&amp;rsquo;ll use http://imyuvii.com as an example. Before starting you will need an AWS account and your DNS added in route53.
So Why to use S3 and why not EC2?  It&amp;rsquo;ll be cheaper because you&amp;rsquo;re not paying for an always running instance and EBS volumes. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about stability and patching of your container. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about web servers.</description>

      <description>Did you notice? Yii creates strange set of directories names like 8523d23 or 10s89b92 in assets directory, and this even happens at runtime.
Yii Assets Many applications are entirely self contained, and there’s no trouble or conflict putting necessary resources (images, CSS files, Javascript files, etc.) under the webroot:
 webroot/css/* webroot/js/* webroot/images/*  and so on. If a module needs to add one more resources, it’s added directly and referenced by the path down from webroot.</description>

      <description>Once you’ve put in all the hard work of creating a website, you need to get it on the web so people can navigate to it and access its content. This process is called deployment. Deployment is a fancy word for “getting your website on the web,”. Website deployment isn’t a simple process, mainly because there are so many different ways to do it. In this article I don’t aim to document all possible methods.</description>

Hence, I thought to use SSH Config file.</description>
