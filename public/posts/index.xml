      <description>Not everyone aware about PHP‘s capabilities of making SSH connections and executing remote commands, but it can be very handy. I’ve been using it a lot in PHP CLI applications that I run from cronjobs, but initially it was a pain to get it to work. The PHP manual on Secure Shell2 Functions is not very practical or methodical for that matter, so I would like to share my understandings on how to make setting this up in less time.</description>

 Using Beta Builder (MacOS only) Manually  Using Beta Builder  Archive your build.</description>

      <description>Did you notice? Yii creates strange set of directories names like 8523d23 or 10s89b92 in assets directory, and this even happens at runtime.
Yii Assets Many applications are entirely self contained, and there’s no trouble or conflict putting necessary resources (images, CSS files, Javascript files, etc.) under the webroot:
 webroot/css/* webroot/js/* webroot/images/*  and so on. If a module needs to add one more resources, it’s added directly and referenced by the path down from webroot.</description>

Hence, I thought to use SSH Config file.</description>

Export a Large Database $ mysqldump -u [USERNAME] -p [DBNAME] | gzip &amp;gt; [/path_to_file/DBNAME].sql.gz MySQL Import a Large Database # First, unzip the file. $ gzip -d [/path_to_file/DBNAME].</description>
